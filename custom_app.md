# Day 6 & 7: Custom Application Creation - Your Choice, Your Design! - Released 9:00 AM PST, Dec 10, 2023

**Objective:**

Build a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook-based application that synthesizes the skills and techniques acquired from the daily challenges. This application can leverage a vector database (such as  LanceDB) / or a similarity search library like ScaNN, FAISS or your own code for search functionality if needed, Prediction Guard LLM API services, stable diffusion notebooks etc. Extra points for including multi modalities like text, video, audio etc. We are leaving the challenge wide open!


**Constraints:**

Remember that the development is constrained to a Jupyter notebook environment without root access, so if you are choosing a front-end interface, then it should be something that can be embedded into a jupyter notebook â€“ javascript, ipywidgets, Panel etc could be used. This requires efficient resource management and adherence to the available computational limits.


**Some ideas to spark your creativity:**

- A **system of agents** : A system comprising agents that construct and interact within a virtual world governed by specific rules and limitations 
- **AI-Driven Recipe Creator and Visualizer:** This application could generate unique recipes based on user-input ingredients, dietary preferences, or cuisine types. The twist here is to use generative AI to create vivid visual representations of the final dish. Additionally, it could pair the recipe with a recommended beverage using a knowledge database.
- **Virtual Fashion Designer:** This application could create fashion designs based on current trends, user preferences, or even the user's own sketches. It could further leverage GenAI to interpret the sketches, suggest improvements or variations, and generate images of models wearing the designed outfits.
- **Automated News Illustrator:** This project would involve creating a tool that takes news articles or headlines and uses generative AI to create relevant illustrations or infographics. This could be a great way to engage users in current events with visually appealing content.
- **Historical Event Re-creation Tool:** This application can take historical events as input and use generative AI to create visualizations of these events, including key figures, locations, and moments. It can be educational, allowing users to visually explore different periods in history.

**Resources:** Explore the impressive creations from our participants in the slack channel for Advent of Gen AI, along with all the [resources](https://github.com/adventofgenai/resources) and materials used throughout the challenges.

**Deadline:** Tuesday, 8:00 AM PST , 2023.

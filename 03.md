**Objective:** Create a **animated** visual narrative through a sequence of image-to-image transformations using Stable Diffusion models. You can transform a base image step by step, following a chosen theme, to illustrate a progression or change. The final result can be a series of static images or a GIF that shows the transformation journey.
Hints:

- **Starting Point:** Begin with a base image that sets the stage for your narrative. This could be a simple sketch, a photograph, or any image that serves as a starting point for your story.
- **Image Transformation:** Use the image-to-image capabilities of Stable Diffusion to transform your base image step by step. Each transformation should represent a progression or a change in your narrative.
- **Prompt Crafting:** For each transformation, carefully craft prompts that guide the Stable Diffusion model. Be specific about the changes you want to see but remember to keep your prompts clear and not overly complicated to avoid confusion.
- **Sequence & Flow:** Ensure that each transformation logically follows from the previous one, maintaining a clear and coherent flow in your narrative. Think of each image as a frame in a flipbook that when put together tells a complete story.
- **Experimentation:** Experiment with different backgrounds, styles, and elements to see how they alter your narrative. For instance, changing the background to a snowy landscape or a rainstorm can add dramatic effects to your story.

**Technical Setup**: Utilize the provided notebooks for text to image generator and image to image generator and consider downloading custom models from Huggingface if needed, such as inpainting models, to enhance your transformations. Set up your pipeline using the necessary libraries and the Stable Diffusion model.

The set of images combined together to create a dynamic experience üöÄ‚ú®, like my somewhat modest (but still awesome! üòé) attempt below. You can merge both text-to-image üìùüñºÔ∏è and image-to-image üñºÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏èüñºÔ∏è stable diffusion techniques using the 2 notebooks provided on IDC under Gen AI Essentials. üåü Check out the notebooks   [here](https://github.com/rahulunair/genAI) üéâüë©‚Äçüíª for a blast of creativity!.

**How I created the panning and glide effect (Starter code)**

To weave these individual moments into a  narrative, I generated a set of images and used the following script to stitch them together into a GIF. But don't let this script be the limit ‚Äì there's so much more awesomeness you can add to it!

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.animation as animation
from PIL import Image
import os

def glide_through(image, frame, total_frames, glide_speed=0.1):
    canvas_width, canvas_height = image.size
    glide_length = glide_speed * frame * canvas_width / total_frames
    left_edge = min(glide_length, canvas_width)
    right_edge = left_edge + canvas_width
    return image.crop((left_edge, 0, right_edge, canvas_height))

seasons_gallery = 'path_to_your_images'
season_snaps = [os.path.join(seasons_gallery, snap) for snap in sorted(os.listdir(seasons_gallery)) if snap.lower().endswith('.png')]
picture_frame = plt.figure()
frames_per_season = 10
seasonal_frames = []

for snap in season_snaps:
    season = Image.open(snap)
    for frame in range(frames_per_season):
        season_view = glide_through(season, frame, frames_per_season)
        season_plot = plt.imshow(season_view, animated=True)
        plt.axis('off')
        seasonal_frames.append([season_plot])

seasons_show = animation.ArtistAnimation(picture_frame, seasonal_frames, interval=100, blit=True, repeat_delay=1000)
#plt.show()
seasons_show.save('seasons_journey.gif', writer='pillow')
```

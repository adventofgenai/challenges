**Objective:**

Develop a Python-based tool using [RAG](https://docs.predictionguard.com/usingllms/augmentation#retrieval-augmentated-generation-rag) with a vector DB like [LanceDB](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb),  Prediction Guard LLM APIs (e.g., with the [WizardCoder model](https://docs.predictionguard.com/models/details) or local LLM models like CodeLLama on IDC to generate concise explanations for Python code snippets. The solution should leverage open-source documentation and datasets to offer accurate, user-friendly insights into code functionality, focusing on clarity and ease of understanding.

The tool should have a user inteface (not a front end, this could be a input box in Jupyter Notebook) that takes python code and natural language questions as input and should be able to respond accurately to answer their question. Our challenge 4 is all about RAG and LLMs, so if you are new to Advent of GenAI and want to learn about RAG, please checkout the resources on [challenge 4](./04.md)

**Hints:**

- Begin by understanding how RAG can be applied to explain code. RAG's retrieval component can pull relevant documentation or examples from the vector database, while the generation component formulates the explanation.
- Choose an appropriate vector database that contains a wealth of Python documentation, code snippets, and explanations. This could include sources like Stack Overflow, GitHub repositories, or Python's official documentation.
- Integrate a model using Prediction Guard LLM API like WizardCoder, or utilize the local CodeLlama model available in the example notebooks on [IDC](https://github.com/rahulunair/genAI/blob/main/LLM_finetuning.ipynb). These models are specifically designed to understand and generate programming-related content, thereby enhancing the quality of the explanations provided by your tool.
- Focus on making the tool user-friendly, ensuring that it can accept code snippets in various forms and provide explanations in simple, easy-to-understand language.


**Technical Setup:**

Select a vector database, add extensive Python docs to it and integrate a model using Prediction Guardâ€™s LLM API such as WizardCoder or use a local model like codeLlama for generating explanations. Utilize the RAG to link code snippets with relevant and accurate documentation and explanations.


**Documentation:**

Document the development process, including the selection of databases, integration of LLM APIs, and any challenges faced,any limitations that you saw in ensuring the accuracy and clarity of explanations.

**Difficulty:** Advanced
